The examples listed here use the Python ComBat algorithm on the bladderbatch data set split into two files: one contains the genetic expression info (expr), and the other contains batch ids in the same order as the listed cell lines, as well as columns used to designate various covariates (pheno - e.g., age and/or cancer status), which can further be used to adjust the original data.

MeanandVariance uses the minimal settings - no model matrix to identify covariates, adjusts for both location and scale, and does not use a referance batch.
