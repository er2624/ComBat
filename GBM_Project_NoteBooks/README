ComBat_in_Python contains the minimum essential elements of ComBat along with a brief description of each key piece. This is a build upon the code by BrentP referenced in the main README, and now includes both the mean_only and ref_batch option provided in the R version of ComBat. This allows for location only adjustment in cases were scale adjustment may not be biologically appropriate, and for designation of a reference batch to which all other batches may be adjusted while the reference batch itself remains unchanged (something that may be useful in machine learning applications). 

However, like the BrenP code, this still does not feature a non-parametric option. 

The two worked examples use 7 databanks (described within the code) to compile a list of ~12,000 genes with expression data for ~400 individual cell "line" samples (many of which are not actual immortalized cell lines - the list includes neurospheres, patient samples, etc).

Both examples use the mean only version of ComBat on all ~12,000 genes specified (both cancer implicated and non cancer implicated), and the second example denoted CCLE uses that databank as a reference batch.

The Data are visualized using MDS, and results are also available with multiple different reference batches for cancer implicated, non cancer implicated, and house keeping genes as well.

Each run is assessed using spearman correlation to enusre pre-and post ComBat validity.
